So, this is it!

If I can get over all the tardiness, my musings will be surfacing  here. Wondering who's Boo Radley? A character from the refreshing fiction 'To kill a mocking bird' who stayed indoors yet lived outdoors in the minds of the curious children around the neighborhood. Interestingly, he came out at the crunch time and did what he needed to do. I am also confined indoors yet my mind travels the world on the wheels of its musings. Hence, borrowing the name from Boo. This blog will take you wherever my musings take me. So, enjoy the ride with me fellas, *কারণ, লাস্ট বাসে আর ফেরা নেই , মাথা তুলবার তাড়া নেই।*
