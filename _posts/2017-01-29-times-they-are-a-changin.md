>“We’re finding ourselves on the front line, we don’t want to be there.”

Six years ago the famous muslim cleric in America, Yasir Qadhi, had said those words for a [New York Times interview.](http://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/20/magazine/mag-20Salafis-t.html)

January 2017.

One week into the Trump Presidency.

Two mosques burned down in Texas and muslims held in airports across America barred from entering the land of opportunities.  

Yasir Qadhi and his fellow american muslims find themselves in the front line again. This time around, possibly to be held accountable to their post-9/11 rhetoric.

Back then, the idea was that- *"those fights (in Iraq and Afghanistan)  are not ours, as Westerners, to fight”* and *“My hands are tied, and my tongue is silent.”* But today with muslim bans and the possibility of a muslim registry looming in the horizon, this fight is surely personal to Yasir Qadhi and how he resorts back to his silent faculties of hands and tongue remains an intriguing discourse to look forward to. Because before he felt, *“We need to make sure that our children can live freely, and we’re going to fight for that freedom. And every time I use that word, I need to make a disclaimer — I don’t mean ‘fight’ in the Tea Party sense of overthrowing the government.”* Whether the sense of the word **‘fight’** changes now is a timely question to put forward to Mr. Qadhi.

In a post-9/11 America, Mr.Qadhi vehemently opposed the idea of seeing America as an entity against Islam and muslims. When confronted by a student on this topic, *“If we’re not at war, why is America killing Muslims throughout the world?”*, Mr.Qadhi replied rhetorically with, *“If we are at war, how can we live in America peacefully?”* This rhetoric is losing it’s appeal by the minute, thanks to Donald J. Trump and the people of America who put him in the office.

Justifying his shift of position on a wide array of issues, he had clarified,  *“It was a pre-9/11 world. The circumstances did not dictate that we think critically.”* And so, his post-9/11 critical thinking guided him to the conclusion that - *“There is no better place to be Muslim than in America”.*

When federal agents raided 15 local Islamic offices and homes in the 9/11 aftermath, Mr. Qadhi  preferred to *“liken his country to Abyssinia, the seventh-century African kingdom that gave refuge to the prophet’s followers,”* while his formerly renowned counterpart, Anwar al-Awlaki,  whom Mr.Qadhi has successfully outlasted in terms of longevity although questionably ideologically,  bellowed in [an audio address](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lOB1U4b-1gg), “It’s a war against Muslims and Islam. It’s happening right here in America,” Mr. Awlaki, by contrast, compared *"America with ancient Mecca, where the prophet’s followers were persecuted, forcing them to flee and later fight back.”*

As it stands, Mr. Qadhi’s ideas that emanated from  critical thinking are at odds again with the black and white rhetoric of the jihadists. However, this time Mr. Qadhi might find it more difficult to walk up to a Homeland Security Official and convince him by saying,

>“Hi, I’m a pacifist Salafi.”
