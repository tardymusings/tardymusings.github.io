জঙ্গিবাদ নিয়ে পড়াশোনা এখন সময়ের দাবি। কোনো আদর্শকে গলা টিপে মারা যায় না। তাই আদর্শের সাথে লড়াই করতে আদর্শকে চেনা জরুরী। প্রতিটি আক্রমণের পর CNN এর উপস্থাপকদের মতো করে *Why do they hate us* বলে সমাধান আশা করা দুরাশা বৈকি। বলা বাহুল্য আমাদের দেশের বুদ্ধিজীবিরাও এই ধারা থেকে খুব দূর নন। *"What you know can not really hurt you"*, তাই জঙ্গিবাদের পেছনের কারণ, মতাদর্শ ও মোটিভেশান জানা খুবই গুরুত্বপূর্ণ। তাই, CIA'র বিন লাদেন ইউনিট এর প্রধান মাইকেল শইয়ারের এই বই হাতে নেওয়া। বইটির কিছু অংশ এখানে তুলে ধরা হলো আপনাদেরকেও পাঠে আগ্রহী করার জন্য। ইচ্ছা আছে সামনে বইটি অনুবাদ করার। মূল ইংরেজি বইটি ডাউনলোড করতে পারেন [এখানে](http://bookzz.org/book/1242822/981b49)

## Change of positions of distinguished scholarly persons

- [Al-Awdah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salman_al-Ouda), however, systematically recanted his earlier positions and found lucrative, regime-sponsored teaching and media posts open to him. He eventually publicly denounced bin Laden.

- When later released, [al-Hawali](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safar_Al-Hawali) kept quiet on most issues that had earned him jail time, although he later issued a fatwa justifying the 9/11 attacks.

## Attack of takfiri groups on Osama
- Oddly, despite the long-standing record of takfiri hatred for bin Laden, several reputed al-Qaeda experts describe bin Laden, al-Qaeda, and the Taleban as adhering closely to takfiri doctrine.

## Al-Qaeda core objectives

﻿
And so the United States would henceforth be al-Qaeda’s fixed objective, with bin Laden arguing that the victory God promised Muslims could be achieved if they pursued three war aims:

-  drive the United States from as much of the Muslim world as possible;

-  destroy Israel and the oppressive Muslim tyrannies; and

-  settle accounts with the heretical Shia.

**Bin Laden insisted, moreover, that the three goals be pursued seriatim and not in parallel.**


## Reasons for attacking USA

1. The U.S. military and civilian presence in the Prophet’s homeland on the Arabian Peninsula.

2. Washington’s protection and support for tyrannical Muslim governments.

3. Washington’s unquestioning and unqualified support for Israel.

4. Washington’s support for countries that oppress Muslims, especially Russia, China, and India.

5. U.S. and Western exploitation of Muslim energy resources at below-market prices.

6. The U.S. military presence in the Muslim world outside the Arab Peninsula.



## About the stature of AQ forces against Northern Alliance in Afganisthan

About the al-Qaeda force, Roy Gutman has written in his excellent book *How We Missed the Story* that bin Laden’s men were **_“ready to fight to the death and were the most feared by Massoud’s commanders.”_**

## Thoughts on propaganda

>**_“Our silence is our real propaganda. Rejections, explanations, or corrigendum only waste your time, and through them, the enemy wants you to engage in things which are not of use to you. These things are pulling you away from your cause. The Western media is unleashing such baseless propaganda, which makes us surprised, but it reflects on what is in their hearts and gradually they themselves will be captive of this propaganda. They become afraid of it and begin to cause harm to themselves. Terror is the most dreaded weapon in the modern age and the Western media is mercilessly using it against their own people . . . . You can understand what the performance in war will be of the nation which suffers from fear and helplessness.”_**

## On Probability of success of Osama's campaign

It is, I think, fair to paraphrase Lincoln and say if Muslims fail bin Laden then he is beaten.
